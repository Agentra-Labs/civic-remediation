# Civic Remediation System 🏙️✨

**Surgical Civic Intervention. Powered by Autonomous Agents.**

---

## ⚡ The Manifesto

The world doesn't need another chatbot. It needs **solutions**.

We see the potholes, the overflowing waste, the crumbling infrastructure. We see the paperwork piling up while our cities decay. The old way—bureaucratic, slow, opaque—is broken.

**We are building the alternative.**

This is a **digital task force** designed for one purpose: to identify, analyze, and **solve** systemic civic failures. It doesn't just talk; it hunts for root causes, engineers solutions, and finds the funding to make them real.

> *"What if an AI could scan the world for problems, figure out how to fix them, and then actually make it happen?"*

We are making that "What if" a reality.

## 🧬 This Is Not RAG. This Is a Converging Singularity.

Most agent systems diverge—they generate endless lists of "ideas" and "options" that go nowhere.

**We built a Converging Singleton Pipeline.**

It doesn't give you 10 options. It gives you **THE ONE**.

1.  **Selects ONE Critical Problem.**
2.  **Identifies ONE Root Cause.**
3.  **Target ONE Responsible Department.**
4.  **Engineers ONE Technical Solution.**
5.  **Secures ONE Funding Source.**

Focus is power. By narrowing the aperture, we force the system to reason, critique, and select only the highest-probability path to impact.

## 🤖 The Elite Task Force

Your team of autonomous specialists. No generalists allowed.

### 🔭 Sentinel (The Scout)
**Mission:** Filter signal from noise.
Scans the planetary data stream (News, Socials, Reports) to detect high-impact systemic failures. It ignores the trivial to focus on the critical.

### 🔎 Investigator (The Detective)
**Mission:** Uncover the hidden truth.
Symptoms are distractions. The Investigator digs deep to find the *actual* technical or structural failure point.

### 🏛️ Bureaucrat (The Mapper)
**Mission:** Navigate the labyrinth.
Identifies the exact specific government body with the jurisdiction, mandate, and budget to act.

### 🛠️ Engineer (The Solver)
**Mission:** Architect the fix.
Matches the root cause to a scalable, modular, and proven technical intervention (e.g., decentralized STPs, LoRaWAN sensor arrays).

### 🤝 Liaison (The Closer)
**Mission:** Secure the capital.
Scans global grants, CSR funds, and government schemes to find the money that fits the mission.

## 🛠️ Built for Builders: The AgentraLabs Way

We are pushing the boundaries of what open-source agent development looks like. This repository isn't just code; it's a glimpse into the future of **Agentic DevOps**.

### Empowered by the [AgentraLabs](https://x.com/AgentraLabs) Toolchain

We use the most advanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to give our agents—and our developers—superpowers:

*   **🧠 Nia MCP**: The "Brain" of the repo. We use Nia to gain deep semantic understanding of our own codebase, automatically refactor legacy patterns, and ensure architectural purity. Use Nia to explore this repo like a pro.
*   **💾 Polydev MCP**: The "Memory". Polydev provides persistent, cross-session context and memory, allowing us to build agents that learn and adapt over time rather than resetting every run.

**This is how the future is built.**

## 🚀 Run the System

### Prerequisites
*   **Python** (via `uv`)
*   **Docker** (for the brain)
*   **Agno** (The framework)

### 1. Ignite
```bash
# Install the next-gen package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync the matrix
uv sync

# Wake the brain
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Execute (Singleton Mode)
Run the converging pipeline to generate a focused project blueprint:
```bash
uv run python -m app.main "Pollution of the Ganga River"
```

### 3. AgentOS (The Command Center)
Visualize the hive mind:
```bash
uv run -m app.agent_os
```
